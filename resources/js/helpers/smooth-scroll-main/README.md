# smooth-scroll

The effect works on the function taking three arguments (target, speed, smooth).
- **target**: The thing which you want to animate (document chosen by default)
- **speed**: The amount of pixel to be scrolled per mousewheel step
- **smooth**: The smooth factor, the higher the value, the more the target smoothes
